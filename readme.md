Colorful Nebula Animation
This project generates a colorful nebula animation effect using JavaScript. It creates a canvas element dynamically on the webpage and animates particles representing nebula in various colors moving across the canvas.

Description
The animation consists of small particles moving across the canvas randomly. Each particle represents a tiny element of the nebula and is drawn in a random color chosen from a predefined array of colors. The particles move with a random velocity within the canvas, creating a dynamic and colorful nebula-like effect.

Usage
To use this animation effect, simply include the index.js file in your HTML document. The script will dynamically create a canvas element on the webpage and start rendering the colorful nebula animation automatically.

Contributing
Contributions to enhance or optimize the animation effect are welcome. Please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
